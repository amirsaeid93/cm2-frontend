In this coding marathon our group, group 5 decided to do all the coding all of us, because we wanted to get a better learning experience and also due to that there was only 3 of us present during fridays class. We manage to do together till the end of iteration 2 on fridays morning class and after decided to continue separetely but if anyone was stuck somewhere we agreed that we can ask from each other on our discord group. But Anyways we (me:Amir Saeid Taebnia, Miro Valtonen, Neo Wade) agreed also to push it seperately to our own repositories.
My prediction of my points for this coding marathon is 115 points.
